# Introduction

Welcome to the Random Restaurant where we serve you whatever we feel like. How are we still in business you may ask? Well we aren't quite sure ourselves. Either way let's get started!

## Instructions

If you look in `main.js` you will see our available menu options. Whenever a person wants something to eat, we will serve them one of these meals at random.

1. We need to ask the customer if they want to eat something. If they say `no`, then we can send them an `alert()` to step aside. If they do want to eat then we will need to get their name.

2. Prompt a customer who wants to eat for their name. If they don't give us a name then keep asking them for one until we have it.

3. Print out a message with the random meal we have selected along with the customers name. Make sure that the meal is being selected at random and that every meal has the potential to be picked!
